# Git Flow
To create a GitFlow for a package within your monorepo, you would follow GitFlow’s branching model specifically for that package, which is still part of the larger monorepo. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to integrate GitFlow into your package development and maintain it within a monorepo structure.

### Prerequisites:
- GitFlow should be initialized in your monorepo.
- Your monorepo should be organized with individual packages inside the `packages/` directory.
- Each package will have its own versioning and development cycle, but it still follows the overall GitFlow model used by the entire monorepo.

### 1. **Initialize GitFlow in Your Monorepo**

If GitFlow has not been initialized yet, you can initialize it with the following command:

```bash
git flow init
```

This will guide you through setting up the branches for GitFlow. Typically, you'll configure:
- `master` (or `main`) as the production branch.
- `develop` as the integration branch where all features are merged.
- `feature/*` for feature development branches.
- `release/*` for preparing a new release.
- `hotfix/*` for quick fixes on production.

Once initialized, you will have the basic structure in place.

### 2. **Work on a Package in a Feature Branch**

To work on a specific package (e.g., `package-1`), start by creating a feature branch:

```bash
git flow feature start package-1-feature
```

This will create a branch like `feature/package-1-feature` based off `develop`.

Make sure you’re working on the correct package inside the `packages/` directory.

Example:
```bash
cd packages/package-1
```

#### 2.1. **Make Changes in the Package**

Make the necessary changes in the package (e.g., update dependencies, implement new features, fix bugs, etc.). If needed, update the `package.json` for versioning, dependencies, etc.

```json
{
  "name": "package-1",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "description": "A cool package",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

#### 2.2. **Write and Run Tests**

Write or update tests for your changes in the `/test` directory for `package-1`.

To run the tests for `package-1` locally, navigate to the package directory and use Yarn:

```bash
cd packages/package-1
yarn install
yarn test
```

Ensure all tests pass before continuing.

### 3. **Commit and Push Changes**

After testing, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature to package-1"
```

Push your feature branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/package-1-feature
```

### 4. **Create a Pull Request (PR) for the Feature**

After pushing your feature branch, create a pull request (PR) to merge it into the `develop` branch. This allows for review and automatic test runs in your CI/CD pipeline.

If you're using GitHub, GitLab, or another platform, open a pull request for your feature branch.

Alternatively, you can finish the feature branch locally with GitFlow:

```bash
git flow feature finish package-1-feature
```

This will:
- Merge `feature/package-1-feature` into `develop`.
- Delete the `feature/package-1-feature` branch locally.

Push the changes back to the remote:

```bash
git push origin develop
```

### 5. **Release Process for a Package**

Once you are ready to release a new version of `package-1`, you will start a release branch. For example, if `package-1` is ready for version `1.2.0`:

```bash
git flow release start 1.2.0
```

Now, the release branch will be created, and you can finalize version numbers or make any last-minute changes.

#### 5.1. **Finalizing the Release**

Make any final changes needed for the release of `package-1` (e.g., updating the `package.json` version number). Once it's ready, finish the release:

```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0
```

This will:
- Merge the release branch into `develop` and `master` (or `main`).
- Tag the release (`v1.2.0`).
- Delete the release branch.

Push the changes and tags:

```bash
git push origin develop
git push origin master
git push origin --tags
```

### 6. **Hotfix for a Package**

If a critical issue is found in `package-1` after the release, you can create a hotfix branch:

```bash
git flow hotfix start package-1-hotfix
```

Make your changes and fixes, then finish the hotfix:

```bash
git flow hotfix finish package-1-hotfix
```

This will:
- Merge the hotfix into both `develop` and `master` (or `main`).
- Create a new version tag for the hotfix.

Push the changes and tags:

```bash
git push origin develop
git push origin master
git push origin --tags
```

### 7. **Versioning for the Package**

Throughout the GitFlow process, your version numbers will evolve according to semantic versioning (e.g., `major.minor.patch`). You can update the version by using the following Git commands:

- **Patch version**: `git flow release start <next-version>`
- **Minor version**: Same as above but adjusting for minor updates.
- **Major version**: Major changes or breaking changes.

GitFlow handles versioning for you when you create a release or hotfix.

### 8. **CI/CD Integration for the Package**

If you’re using a CI/CD pipeline, ensure that the tests for `package-1` are run when PRs are opened for the `feature/*` or `release/*` branches. You can set this up in services like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, **CircleCI**, or **Jenkins**.

Here’s an example GitHub Actions workflow for testing a package:

```yaml
name: Package-1 Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/*
      - release/*
      - develop

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      - name: Run tests
        run: yarn test
```

This will trigger the tests on any push to `feature/*`, `release/*`, or `develop`.

### Summary:

1. **Initialize GitFlow** for your monorepo if not already done.
2. **Create a Feature Branch** for each package using `git flow feature start`.
3. **Make changes** to the package, run tests locally, and commit changes.
4. **Push changes** and create a PR for review.
5. **Finish the Feature** branch with `git flow feature finish` and merge it into `develop`.
6. **Release the Package** by starting a release branch and finalizing it with `git flow release finish`.
7. **Manage Hotfixes** with `git flow hotfix`.
8. **Automate Testing** via CI/CD for continuous testing during feature and release processes.

By following this process, you ensure that each package is managed effectively within the larger monorepo using GitFlow.
