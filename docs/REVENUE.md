# Creating a Report of Revenues by Geographc Region
This type of report is useful for intra-state offerings to ensure compliance with the offering as the issuer must generate revenue in one geographic region region before an intra-state offering can be conduxted in that region. For example, under Section 3(a)(11) permits an issuer to perform an exempt offering in the state they are registered as a Domestic entity and must have the majority of the revenue generated in that state. If PRESSPAGE ENTERTAINMENT INC, who is registered in the State of Florida wishes to initiate a Section 3(a)(11) in Florida to only Florida bonafide residents, the company must show the majority of their revenue is generated within the boundary of the State of Florida?

A **Geographic Revenue Report** or a **Revenue by Region Report** typically shows the allocation of revenue based on geographic regions. This financial report breaks down revenue by country, state, city, or region, providing insights into how much income is being generated from different locations.

Here are some types of financial reports that include geographic revenue allocation:

1. **Segment Reporting** (Geographic Segmentation):  
   This type of report is commonly used in **financial statements** as part of the segment reporting section. Publicly traded companies often break down revenues by geographic regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific).

2. **Sales by Region Report**:  
   Typically generated internally by sales teams or through accounting systems, this report shows the revenue attributed to various geographical areas.

3. **Income Statement (with Geographic Segmentation)**:  
   In some cases, companies present a detailed **income statement** that includes geographical breakdowns, either by revenue alone or with associated costs and profits for each region.

4. **Revenue Dashboard (with Geographic Filters)**:  
   Companies using financial analytics tools like Power BI, Tableau, or QuickBooks often generate **custom dashboards** that include geographic breakdowns of revenue using maps or charts.

## How to set up such reports
Setting up a **Geographic Revenue Report** involves a combination of organizing your data, choosing the right software or system, and configuring the report to display revenue by region. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create such reports:

### Step 1: Collect and Organize Geographic Revenue Data
Before you can create a geographic revenue report, ensure that your data is well-organized:

- **Capture Location Data**: For each revenue transaction, ensure you’re tracking the **location** where the revenue was generated. This could be based on customer address, sales region, or the location of your company’s branch that facilitated the transaction.
  - If using an **accounting system**, you’ll need fields for capturing country, state, or other location information.
  - In **e-commerce**, customer billing or shipping addresses can be used.
  
- **Assign Regions to Revenue**: Depending on your reporting requirements, group locations into broader **geographical regions** (e.g., Europe, Asia-Pacific, North America) or keep them specific (e.g., by country or state).

### Step 2: Choose Your Reporting Tool
Next, choose the tool you'll use to generate the report. Here are common options:

- **Accounting Software**: Many systems like **QuickBooks**, **Xero**, or **NetSuite** have built-in reporting tools that can generate revenue reports segmented by location.
  
- **Spreadsheet Programs**: For a custom solution, you can use **Excel** or **Google Sheets** to manually create geographic reports if your data is in CSV or spreadsheet format.
  
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools**: Tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Google Data Studio** can visualize revenue geographically with maps and charts, offering advanced filtering capabilities.

- **ERP Systems**: For larger organizations, **ERP systems** like **SAP** or **Oracle ERP** have built-in segment reporting functionality.

### Step 3: Set Up the Report in Your Chosen Tool
Once your data is ready and you’ve selected your tool, follow these general steps to set up the report:

#### For Accounting Software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero)
1. **Access Reports**: Navigate to the **reports** section in your software.
2. **Select Geographic Revenue Report**: Look for a pre-built **Sales by Location** or **Revenue by Region** report. In some systems, you may have to customize an existing sales report.
3. **Apply Filters**:
   - Filter by **date range** to capture the period you are interested in.
   - Set up filters for **location** (country, state, region) or use location-based tags or segments.
4. **Customize Columns/Rows**:
   - Add additional columns if necessary (e.g., product/service sold, customer name).
   - Group or sort the data by the desired geographic units (e.g., by country or region).
5. **Run Report and Export**: Run the report, and if needed, export it in **PDF**, **Excel**, or another format for further analysis.

#### For Excel or Google Sheets
1. **Input Data**: Start by importing your raw revenue data into Excel or Sheets, making sure to include columns for:
   - Date of transaction
   - Revenue amount
   - Geographic location (e.g., country, state, region)
   
2. **Create Pivot Table**:
   - Go to the **Insert** tab and select **Pivot Table**.
   - Set the **rows** to be the geographic location (country/region).
   - Set the **values** to sum up the revenue amounts.
   
3. **Group by Region** (Optional):
   - If necessary, group countries or states into larger regions.
   
4. **Visualize with Charts/Maps**:
   - Use **Pivot Charts** or **Geo Maps** (available in Google Sheets) to create a visual representation of your geographic revenue.

#### For Power BI or Tableau
1. **Connect Data Source**: Import your data source (e.g., a CSV, database, or directly from accounting software) into Power BI or Tableau.
   
2. **Set Up Geographic Data**: Ensure your revenue data includes geographic fields like **country**, **state**, or **region**.
   - Map these fields to a **geographic dimension** in the tool. In Power BI and Tableau, these fields can automatically be used in **map visualizations**.
   
3. **Create Map Visualization**:
   - Choose a **map chart** in Power BI or Tableau.
   - Set the **location** field as the geographic axis (country, region, etc.).
   - Set the **revenue** field as the size or color of the map markers or regions.
   
4. **Filter and Customize**:
   - Add **filters** to narrow the data to specific regions, date ranges, or other criteria.
   - Customize the **map** to show revenue distribution and group locations as needed.
   
5. **Generate Report**: After customizing the visualization, generate the report and export or share it with stakeholders.

### Step 4: Analyze and Share the Report
- **Interpret Results**: Use the report to identify trends such as which regions are generating the most revenue and where there might be growth opportunities or underperformance.
  
- **Share**: Export the report to PDF, Excel, or other formats and distribute it to key stakeholders or use the **dashboard-sharing** features in tools like Power BI or Tableau.

### Additional Tips:
- **Automate the Process**: If your accounting system or BI tool allows it, automate the generation of these reports on a **monthly**, **quarterly**, or **annual** basis.
  
- **Drill Down into Data**: Use the **drill-down features** in BI tools or pivot tables to get more granular data (e.g., revenue by city within a country).
  
- **Use Maps for Visualization**: Geographic maps make it easier to visualize and understand the regional distribution of revenue, especially in BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.
