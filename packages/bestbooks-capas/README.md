# BestBooks Accounting Application Framework - CAPAS

The Cost Accounting and Productivity Analysis System (CAPAS) module

## Core Modules
|---------|-------------|-----------|
|Component|	Module Name |Description|
|Cost Classification|CCM|Categorizes costs by behavior (fixed/variable), traceability (direct/indirect), function (production/admin/selling).|
|Cost Center Accounting|CCA|Assigns costs to cost centers (departments, teams, machines, etc.) to monitor performance.|
|Cost Unit / Cost Object Accounting|CUO|Tracks costs per unit of product, service, job, or project.|
|Cost Allocation|CAM|Distributes indirect costs (e.g. rent, utilities) to cost centers or cost objects.|
|Overhead Absorption|OVAM|Applies overhead costs to products or services based on a selected rate or base (labor hours, machine hours, etc.).|
|Activity-Based Costing (ABC)|ABC|Allocates costs based on activities that consume resources, offering more precise cost insight.|
|Job/Batch Costing|JBC|Assigns and tracks costs for individual jobs or batches of production.|
|Process Costing|PCM|Used in continuous production to determine the cost per process or department.|
|Standard Costing|SCM|Uses predetermined costs for materials, labor, and overhead to identify variances against actuals.|
|Marginal/Variable Costing|MVC|Focuses only on variable costs to support short-term decision-making.|
|Budgeting & Forecasting|BFM|Prepares cost budgets and compares them with actuals for variance analysis.|
|Variance Analysis|VAR|Analyzes the differences between standard and actual costs (price variance, efficiency variance, etc.).|
|Cost Control & Monitoring|CCM|Implements controls to reduce and monitor unnecessary or excessive costs.|
|Inventory Valuation|IVM|Determines the cost of raw materials, WIP, and finished goods for accounting and financial reporting.|
|Break-Even Analysis|BEA|Determines the level of sales needed to cover all costs (fixed and variable).|
|Profitability Analysis|PFA|Evaluates the profitability of products, customers, departments, or locations.|
|Transfer Pricing|TXP|Assigns cost values for goods/services exchanged between departments or subsidiaries.|
|Cost Reporting & Dashboards|CRG|	Generates actionable reports: cost sheets, segment summaries, cost center performance.|
