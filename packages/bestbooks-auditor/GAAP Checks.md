During a financial audit, several GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) checks should be performed to ensure that the financial statements are accurate, consistent, and compliant. These checks are crucial for validating the quality and reliability of financial reporting. Below is a list of essential GAAP checks that should be performed during an audit:

### 1. **Revenue Recognition**
   - Ensure revenue is recognized when it is earned and realizable, not necessarily when cash is received. 
   - Check for proper matching of revenue and related expenses (accrual accounting).
   - Verify that all revenue streams are recognized correctly and in line with the company's revenue recognition policies.

### 2. **Expense Recognition (Matching Principle)**
   - Ensure that expenses are recorded in the same period as the revenues they help generate.
   - Verify that expenses related to unearned or deferred revenues are properly accounted for.
   - Check for the proper accrual of expenses that are incurred but not yet paid (e.g., wages, utilities).

### 3. **Completeness and Accuracy**
   - Ensure all financial transactions are recorded and that no material information has been omitted.
   - Compare general ledger entries with source documents (e.g., invoices, bank statements).
   - Cross-check financial records against physical assets or liabilities (e.g., inventory counts, bank balances).

### 4. **Valuation of Assets**
   - Verify that all assets are recorded at the correct value, following applicable valuation methods (e.g., historical cost, fair value).
   - Ensure proper depreciation or amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets.
   - Check for impairment of assets, particularly goodwill, intangible assets, and long-term investments.

### 5. **Inventory Valuation**
   - Ensure that inventory is valued correctly, using appropriate methods like FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), or weighted average cost.
   - Verify that inventory quantities and values are accurate (physical count vs. recorded amounts).
   - Confirm that inventory is not overvalued, and assess for obsolete or unsellable items (inventory impairment).

### 6. **Accounts Receivable and Bad Debts**
   - Verify that accounts receivable are properly recorded and realizable.
   - Check that the company has adequately accounted for potential bad debts by evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts.
   - Review any aging reports to identify old or overdue receivables that should be written off.

### 7. **Accounts Payable and Accruals**
   - Ensure that all obligations (e.g., supplier payments, accrued expenses) are recorded in the correct period.
   - Verify that accounts payable and accrued liabilities are accurately stated.
   - Check for unrecorded liabilities that may have been missed in the financial statements.

### 8. **Equity Transactions**
   - Ensure that any equity-related transactions (e.g., issuance of shares, dividends, treasury stock transactions) are properly recorded and reported.
   - Confirm that the equity section of the balance sheet is consistent with corporate records, including shareholder agreements and minutes from board meetings.

### 9. **Cash Flow Statement Accuracy**
   - Verify the accuracy of the cash flow statement by checking that cash inflows and outflows reconcile with the bank records.
   - Ensure that cash flows are properly classified into operating, investing, and financing activities.

### 10. **Compliance with Disclosure Requirements**
   - Verify that financial statements include all required disclosures, including those related to contingencies, related party transactions, and significant accounting policies.
   - Ensure that the notes to the financial statements comply with GAAP disclosure rules.

### 11. **Consistency Principle**
   - Ensure that the company has consistently applied accounting principles from one period to the next.
   - Check for any changes in accounting policies or estimates and ensure they are disclosed in the financial statements.
   - Confirm that prior period adjustments, if any, are handled correctly.

### 12. **Materiality**
   - Ensure that material transactions are recorded and disclosed in accordance with GAAP.
   - Check that any non-material items are appropriately aggregated and do not mislead users of the financial statements.

### 13. **Conservatism Principle**
   - Ensure that potential liabilities or losses are recognized as soon as they are identified, while gains or revenues are only recognized when they are reasonably certain.
   - Review provisions for contingencies, warranties, or legal liabilities to ensure that conservative estimates have been applied.

### 14. **Going Concern Assumption**
   - Assess whether the company can continue operating for the foreseeable future (typically 12 months from the balance sheet date).
   - Review management's assessment of the company's financial health and any factors that could threaten its viability, such as liquidity issues or covenant violations.

### 15. **Segregation of Duties**
   - Review internal controls to ensure segregation of duties between functions such as authorization, record-keeping, and custody of assets.
   - Ensure that no one individual controls too many aspects of a financial transaction, which could lead to fraud or errors.

### 16. **Fair Presentation of Financial Statements**
   - Ensure that the financial statements fairly present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the company in accordance with GAAP.
   - Look for any significant misstatements or inconsistencies that would distort the true financial performance of the entity.

### 17. **Estimates and Assumptions**
   - Review the reasonableness of management's estimates (e.g., depreciation, amortization, inventory reserves, warranty reserves).
   - Ensure that assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and consistent with GAAP guidelines.

### 18. **Foreign Currency Transactions**
   - Verify that foreign currency transactions are properly recorded in the functional currency.
   - Ensure that exchange rate gains and losses are correctly recognized and reported.

### 19. **Leases**
   - Ensure that leases are classified correctly as either operating or finance leases in accordance with the new GAAP standards (ASC 842).
   - Verify that leased assets and liabilities are properly recorded on the balance sheet, including amortization of lease liabilities.

### 20. **Income Taxes**
   - Verify the accuracy of deferred tax liabilities and assets, and ensure they are properly accounted for in compliance with ASC 740 (Accounting for Income Taxes).
   - Review the tax provision and confirm that it aligns with GAAP standards for both current and deferred taxes.

By performing these checks during an audit, you ensure that financial statements comply with GAAP and reflect a true and fair view of the company's financial health.
