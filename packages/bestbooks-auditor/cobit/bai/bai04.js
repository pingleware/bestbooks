/**
 * When considering levels of business communication, the order typically ranges from the most restricted and confidential to the most open and public. Here is a list of common levels of business communication, listed from confidential to public:
 * 
 * 1. Confidential: Communication at this level is highly sensitive and should only be disclosed to authorized individuals with a need-to-know basis. 
 *                  It often involves proprietary information, trade secrets, or sensitive personal data.
 * 
 * 2. Restricted: Communication at this level is restricted to a specific group of individuals or stakeholders who have been granted access based on their roles or 
 *                  responsibilities. It may include confidential information that is shared within a limited circle of trusted parties.
 * 
 * 3. Internal: Communication at this level is intended for internal use within the organization. It includes information shared among employees, teams, 
 *                  or departments to facilitate internal operations, collaboration, and decision-making.
 * 
 * 4. External: Communication at this level involves sharing information with external parties, such as clients, customers, vendors, or partners. 
 *                  It may include project updates, sales presentations, or discussions related to business relationships.
 * 
 * 5. Public: Communication at this level is meant for the general public and is openly accessible to anyone. 
 *                  It includes public announcements, press releases, marketing materials, and information shared on public platforms like websites, social media, 
 *                  or public forums.
 * 
 * It's important to note that the classification and handling of business communication may vary depending on the organization, industry, and applicable regulations. The above list provides a general framework for understanding the levels of business communication, but specific classification and handling practices should be defined based on organizational policies and requirements.
